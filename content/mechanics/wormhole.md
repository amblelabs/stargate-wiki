      A wormhole is what you "travel" through when entering an active Stargate.
      In game it looks like **this** but will change color depending on the gate
      type.


      In survival if you; go into the receiving gates wormhole, OR walk into the
      kawoosh. YOU WILL DIE (if you are in creative mode, you will be just fine.
      Also in creative you can go through both ways of an active Stargate).
      There is also some unique `death messages` if you die to either of these
      features!
