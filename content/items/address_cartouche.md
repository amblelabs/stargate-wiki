      ## What does the Address Cartouche do?


      *   It can be used to get a Stargates address (by `right-clicking` on the
      Stargates base block) and can be used on both the
      [DHD](https://amblelabs.github.io/stargate-wiki/blocks/dhd/) And
      [Stargate](https://amblelabs.github.io/stargate-wiki/blocks/stargate/). It
      will then automatically dial the address but it wont activate the Stargate
      when it has complete its dialing sequence!
