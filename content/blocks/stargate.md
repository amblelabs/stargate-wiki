There are 2 ways a stargate can spawn, on a plinth and burried

### Plinths:
----
Plinths spawn in all the biomes listed above and look like this (depending on the biome, the block pallet will change)!

## Gate Types

In this mod there is 4 gate types `Milkyway`, `Pegasus`, `Universe`, and `Orlin`. Although they all have the same function, they are each very different.

### Milkyway

![milkyway](images/milkyway.png)

- This gate is the more know one. When dialing, Each `Chevron`will light up when you press a symbol on the dhd. However, if you use `insert mod or feature name here` the gates inner ring will spin till the selected symbol reaches the top `Chevron` Until it `dials` all symbols inputed on the [DHD](content/blocks/dhd.md)

### Pegasus
![pegaSUS](images/pegaSUS.png)
- This gate is all about LEDs, its inner ring doesnt spin at all. Instead each symbol will light up then spin (yes even with a [DHD](content/blocks/dhd.md)). Its `wormhole` is also a different color compaired to the `Milkyway` gate.

### Universe
![universe](images/universe.png)
- This being the first gate ever made, it is more "rustic". The whole gate spins for this type, it rotates until the symbol is at the top of the gate, then it glows. The `wormhole` is also completely differnt to the others. It being more "greyscale" than the others. It also has NO [DHD](content/blocks/dhd.md)

### Orlin
![orlin](images/orlin.png)
- This is the smallest of all the gates and also has no [DHD](content/blocks/dhd.md). But is unique as it is build with blocks (not forgetting the toaster of course).

# Gate Mechanics

If you didnt know, gates are basically used as one way transportation but there is so much more behind them. 

### Basic Gate Functions

### Wormholes

- A wormhole is what you "travel" throught when entering an active stargate. In game it looks like **this** but will change color depending on the gate type. In survival if you; go into the reciving gates wormhole, OR walk into the kawoosh. YOU WILL DIE (if you are are in creative mod, you will be just fine. Also in creative you can go through both ways of an active stargate)

### Irises

- smth smth, you die and they are both good and bad for you
