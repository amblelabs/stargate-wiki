      ## Obtaining a Stargate


      In this mod Stargates are found naturally. They can spawn in many biomes
      and dimensions, including:


      \>\`\`\`


      \> Overworld: Desert, Forest


      \> Nether: Soul Sand Valley


      \> End: End Highlands


      \>\`\`\`


      \----


      There are 2 ways a stargate can spawn, on a plinth and burried.


      \### Plinths:


      \----


      Plinths spawn in all the biomes listed above and look like this (depending
      on the biome, the block pallet will change)!

      \### Burried Gates:


      \----


      Burried Gates ONLY spawn in deserts and will be horizontal in the ground,
      requiring you to dig them out!

      \-----------


      \### Placing the Horizontally


      `INSERT IMAGE HERE`


      \- Like in the show(s), gates can be placed horizontally. Perfect for a
      sacrificial pit or a volcano trash can :D

      \## Gate Types


      In this mod there is 4 gate types `Milkyway`, `Pegasus`, `Universe`, and
      `Orlin`. Although they all have the same function, they are each very
      different.


      \### Milkyway


      \### Pegasus


      ![Pegasus Gate](/stargate-wiki/blocks/images/pegaSUS.png)


      \- This gate is all about LEDs, its inner ring doesnt spin at all. Instead
      each symbol will light up then spin (yes even with a
      \[DHD\]([/stargate-wiki/blocks/dhd/](https://amblelabs.github.io/stargate-wiki/blocks/dhd/))).
      Its `wormhole` is also a different color compaired to the `Milkyway` gate.


      \### Universe


      ![Universe Gate](/stargate-wiki/blocks/images/universe.png)


      \- This being the first gate ever made, it is more "rustic". The whole
      gate spins for this type, it rotates until the symbol is at the top of the
      gate, then it glows. The `wormhole` is also completely differnt to the
      others. It being more "greyscale" than the others. It also has NO
      \[DHD\]([/stargate-wiki/blocks/dhd/](https://amblelabs.github.io/stargate-wiki/blocks/dhd/))!


      \### Orlin


      ![Orlin Gate](/stargate-wiki/blocks/images/orlin.png)


      \- This is the smallest of all the gates and also has no
      \[DHD\]([/stargate-wiki/blocks/dhd/](https://amblelabs.github.io/stargate-wiki/blocks/dhd/)).
      But is unique as it is built with blocks (not forgetting the toaster of
      course).

      ### Milky Way


      ![](/stargate-wiki/blocks/images/milkyway.png)


      \- This gate is the more know one. When dialing, Each `Chevron` will light
      up when you press a symbol on the dhd. However, if you use `insert mod or
      feature name here` the gates inner ring will spin till the selected symbol
      reaches the top `Chevron` Until it `dials` all symbols inputed on the
      \[DHD\]([https://amblelabs.github.io/stargate-wiki/blocks/dhd/](https://amblelabs.github.io/stargate-wiki/blocks/dhd/)).
