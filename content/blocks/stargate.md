      ### Obtaining a Stargate?


      In this mod Stargates are found naturally. They can spawn in many biomes
      and dimensions, including:


      > ```

      > Overworld: Desert, Forest

      > Nether: Soul Sand Valley

      > End: End Highlands

      > ```


      There are 2 ways a Stargate can spawn, on a plinth and buried:
