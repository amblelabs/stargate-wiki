      ### Obtaining a Stargate?


      In this mod Stargates are found naturally. They can spawn in many biomes
      and dimensions, including:


      > ```

      > Overworld: Desert, Forest

      > Nether: Soul Sand Valley

      > End: End Highlands

      > ```


      There are 2 ways a Stargate can spawn, on a plinth and buried:

      ### Plinths:


      *   Plinths spawn in all the biomes listed above and look like this
      (depending on the biome, the block pallet will change)!

      ### Buried Gates:


      *   Buried Gates ONLY spawn in deserts and will be horizontal in the
      ground, requiring you to dig them out!

      ### Placing the Horizontally:


      *   Like in the show(s), gates can be placed horizontally. Perfect for a
      sacrificial pit or a volcano trash can :D. To place a gate horizontally,
      do ...!

      ## Gate Types


      In this mod there is 4 gate types Milky way, Pegasus, Universe, and Orlin.
      Although they all have the same function, they are each very different.

      ### Milky Way:


      *   This gate is the more know one. When dialing, Each Chevron will light
      up when you press a symbol on the dhd. However, if you use insert mod or
      feature name here the gates inner ring will spin till the selected symbol
      reaches the top Chevron Until it dials all symbols imputed on the DHD.

      ### Pegasus:


      *   This gate is all about LED's, its inner ring doesn't spin at all.
      Instead each symbol will light up then spin (yes even with a DHD). Its
      wormhole is also a different color compared to the Milky way gate.

      ### Universe:


      *   This being the first gate ever made, it is more "rustic". The whole
      gate spins for this type, it rotates until the symbol is at the top of the
      gate, then it glows. The wormhole is also completely different to the
      others. It being more "grayscale" than the others. It also has NO DHD!

      ### Orlin:


      *   his is the smallest of all the gates and also has no DHD. But is
      unique as it is built with blocks (not forgetting the toaster of course).
