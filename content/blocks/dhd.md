      ## What is a DHD?


      *   A DHD is a device that is used to dial addresses for Stargates. If you
      press any symbol on the block the Stargate it is linked too will activate
      that same symbol. When you reach the max amount of symbols for that
      address, you then press the big red button in the middle and the gate will
      activate.
          
      *   You can also use an [Address
      Cartouche](https://amblelabs.github.io/stargate-wiki/items/address_cartouche/)
      on a DHD to automatically dial that address (you will however still need
      to press the activation button)!

      (Each symbol panel will also light up when you press the corresponding
      symbol)
